# Windows Platform Development Kit (WPDK)

The Windows Platform Development Kit (WPDK) enables applications based on the Storage Performance Development Kit ([SPDK](http://www.spdk.io)) to build and run as native Windows executables by providing header files and a lightweight library that implement required POSIX/Linux functionality.

It also contains the Windows Driver Unit Test Framework (WDUTF) to enable the unit testing of Windows kernel drivers.
